Fluid-structure interaction simulation in a cerebral aneurysm.

The fluid and solid mesh provided in the "mesh" subfolder were obtained using the vmtk software 
starting from the stl files provided by the Aneurisk project, see

  http://ecm2.mathcs.emory.edu/aneuriskweb/index

Specifically, we consider here the case id C0094.

The "FSI" folder contains the data and main files required to run the simulation. Please note that we 
use the prestressing technique described in the redbKIT documentation, see
