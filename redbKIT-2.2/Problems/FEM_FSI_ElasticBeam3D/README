3D version of the 2D Flow Past an Elastic Beam Attached to a Fixed, Rigid Block
(see FEM_FSI_ElasticBeam2D)

The 3D geometry is obtained by extruding the 2D geometry in the z-direction
(see meshFS.geo file).

This test was used to compare the redbKIT-FSI solver with the one developed
by Davide Forti (EPFL) in the LifeV library.

Instructions:

1) In the mesh subfolder we already provide gmsh script to generate conforming
   fluid and solid meshes. See the script generate_mesh.sh 

2) Launch main.m to start the simulation. The output of interest (i.e. the vertical
   tip displacement at the midplane as a function of time) can be obtained 
   with Paraview by selecting the corresponding mesh node and using the 
   "Plot Selection Over Time" filter.
