2D Scattering problem on a deformable object

For the full description of the problem see:

Instructions:

(1) In the mesh subfolder we already provide the gmsh script to generate the mesh.
    Type in a terminal:

    $ gmsh obstacle.geo -2 -o obstacle_Coarse.msh

(2) Navigate into the "MeshMotion" folder and launch the script Reduced_SEMMT.m
    to generate the reduced-order model for the mesh motion problem.

(3) Add the "MeshMotion" folder to the path

(4) Navigate into the "Scattering" folder and launch the script reduce_SCATTERING.m
    to generate the reduced-order model for the scattering problem.
    The mesh motion is performed by means of the ROM built in (2).
