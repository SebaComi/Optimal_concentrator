Fast spinning top in a gravitational field

This problem simulates the fast spinning of an aluminium top in a gravitational field.

       finite element dynamic models with finite rotations and energy-based mesh
       sampling and weighting for computational efficiency.

Instructions:

1) Launch Solve.m to start the simulation 
   (by default 5000 timesteps are solved, could take around 0.5-2 hours)

2) The output of interest, e.g. the x- and z-displacement at some probes, can be obtained 
   with Paraview by selecting the corresponding mesh node and using the "Plot Selection Over Time" filter.
