Instructions:

1) In the mesh subfolder we already provide gmsh script to generate conforming
   fluid and solid meshes. See the script generate_mesh.sh 

2) Launch main.m to start the simulation. The output of interest (i.e. the vertical
   tip displacement at the midplane as a function of time) can be obtained 
   with Paraview by selecting the corresponding mesh node and using the 
   "Plot Selection Over Time" filter.
