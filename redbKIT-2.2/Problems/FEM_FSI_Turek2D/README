Numerical Benchmarking of fluid-structure interaction between an elastic 
object and laminar incompressible flow.

For the full description of the benchmark see:
   [1] http://www.featflow.de/en/benchmarks/cfdbenchmarking/fsi_benchmark.html

Instructions:

1) In the mesh subfolder we already provide gmsh script to generate conforming
   fluid and solid meshes. See the script generate_mesh.sh 

2) The CSM contains the Computational Solid Mechanics set of tests proposed 
   in [1]. Launch the main file CSM.m to reproduce the results. A comparison
   wiht reference values provided in [1] is automatically performed.

3) The FSI folder contains implementation of tests FSI1 and FSI2 proposed 
   in [1].
